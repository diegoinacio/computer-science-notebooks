    "A [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)) an abstract data structure that is meant to implement concepts from the field of [graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) and [discrete mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)). Graphs are mainly composed of **vertices**, **edges** and **weights**, and its structure can vary depending on the purpose. A vertex can connect to another, so they are adjacent to each other. Each connection is considered an edge and it can be *weited* or *unwaited* (in this case let's consider the weight as 1). Furthermore, a graph can be **directed** (linked asymmetrically) or **undirected** (linked symmetrically). For this article, we are going to approach the **undirected** structure.\n",
